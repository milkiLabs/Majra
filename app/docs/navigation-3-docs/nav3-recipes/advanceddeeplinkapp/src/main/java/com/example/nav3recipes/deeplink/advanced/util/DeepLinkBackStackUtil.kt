 *
 * 1. a backStack with only the deeplinked key if [buildFullPath] is false.
 * 2. a backStack containing the deeplinked key and its hierarchical parent keys
 * if [buildFullPath] is true.
 *
 * In the context of this recipe, [buildFullPath] is true if the deeplink intent has the
 * [android.content.Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK] and [android.content.Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK]
 * flags.
 * These flags indicate that the deeplinked Activity was started as the root Activity of a new Task, in which case
 * a full synthetic backStack is required in order to support the proper, expected back button behavior.
 *
 * If those flags were not present, it means the deeplinked Activity was started
 * in the app that originally triggered the deeplink. In this case, that original app is assumed to
 * already have existing screens that users can system back into, therefore a synthetic backstack
 * is OPTIONAL.
